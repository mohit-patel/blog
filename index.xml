      <title>What Does it Mean to be a Teacher?</title>

      <description>Happy Teachers&amp;rsquo; Day to all teachers.
Hermann Hesse said, &amp;ldquo;Teachers are more essential than anything else, men and women who can give the young the ability to judge and distinguish, who serve them as examples of the honouring of truth, obedience to the things of the spirit&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
Teachers and administrators (us) are essentially humans. We are people before we are teachers. And the failings and travails of being human cannot be discarded in the process of becoming a teacher.</description>

      <title>Discussion on Philosophy of Wildlife Conservation</title>
      <link>https://mohit-patel.github.io/post/philosophy_wildlife/</link>

      <description>I look forward to Fridays each week. Fridays are for Noesis, our philosophy class. Over the years I have veered more and more towards literature and philosophy embedded in literature. But sometimes, we take up something topical and dive deep in to it. 29th July, Friday was International Tiger Day. I thought it would be a good opportunity to discuss about the philosophy of wildlife conservation.
I am deeply moved by the jungles of India.</description>

      <description>Anahata at Raga Svara
It is easy to believe that Raga Svara is a &amp;ldquo;business&amp;rdquo; and that it is different from Northstar or RKU, which are our learning institutions. But that would be an error. If anything, Raga is an even more potent form of learning. Raga is about bringing back the prime mover of transformation within one&amp;rsquo;s self, which so often is not the case in formal learning.</description>

      <description>Imagine you are in a thick forest. The old trees stand guard. The winding river gently invites you deeper. A half-penetrable mist settles over the water. No sound. No birds. Just the gentle trickle of water dropping from the oars. A maddening shriek tears the sky. A primeval scream. Silence. The old trees stand guard against vainglorious usurpers. The river flows. The oars push ahead. A heart of darkness.
Make of it what you will&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <title>Our Own Garden</title>

      <description>Our garden has been barren for many months now. The kids, who tend to this garden, are living strange lives in their own homes; disconnected from each other and from us. This Teachers&amp;rsquo; Day we brought it alive again. It has been two years since we started the horticulture program. As I reflected on why we started this and what it means, I was reminded of Candide by Voltaire.
Travelling through Europe and witnessing poverty, destitution, destruction, corruption and the wickedness of the human soul, Candide and his friends, Professor Pangloss and Martin, arrive in the Ottoman Turkey.</description>

      <title>Money - The Poe Way</title>

      <description>While reading Poe today morning, came across this little gem on making money.
Epigram for Wall Street by Edgar Allan Poe
I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you a plan for gaining wealth, Better than banking, trade or leases,
Take a bank note and fold it up,
And then you will find your money in creases!
This wonderful plan, without danger or loss,
Keeps your cash in your hands, where nothing can trouble it;</description>

      <title>Thoughts on Hospitality</title>
      <link>https://mohit-patel.github.io/post/thoughts_on_hospitality/</link>

      <guid>https://mohit-patel.github.io/post/thoughts_on_hospitality/</guid>
      <description>With Raga Svara, and with Northstar as well, but more acutely at Raga, I come to the question of étranger or xenos. I am unable to take on the role of a subservient host. Hospitality is an act of giving and receiving, a game if you will. The rules and codes must be adhered to. However, it always remains a struggle. It never is a transaction.
While all our services are priced, value truly remains outside of economic rationality.</description>

      <title>Triangulum Galaxy</title>

      <guid>https://mohit-patel.github.io/post/triangulum_galaxy/</guid>
      <description>This is the Triangulum Galaxy. It is a spiral galaxy 2.73 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Triangulum. It is one of the most distant permanent objects that can be viewed with the naked eye. However, it is impossible to see it in any city or small town. There needs to be almost zero light pollution to see it. Even with 150 images stacked together, my image (above) shows a faint galaxy.</description>

      <description>Orion Nebula (M42)
Fire in the sky. Orion Nebula.
My third attempt at this deep sky object. I took over 150 images of 30 seconds each and stacked them together to get a final image. The light pollution is making it more and more difficult to do any night sky observing. The universe is up there to see only if we could be mindful about artificial lights.</description>

      <description>I just completed Turn of the Screw by Henry James. Horrifying in some parts and labrouious to read in most parts. The sentences and sytax is very Henry James-like. </description>

      <description>The central star cluster in this photo is the Globular Cluster in constellation Pegasus. This is my second cluster photo after [[Hercules Globular Cluster]] I have been able to do a better job at the capturing the incredible star density. I do not wish to make technical observations. These photographs are meant to create a poetic image. It has no past and no future. Just an emergence in a reader&amp;rsquo;s psyche.</description>

      <description>I love photographing solitary stars. I love the simplicity of the composition. This is Vega. It is a bright star (brihgtest in the constellation Lyra). Vega used to be Earth&amp;rsquo;s pole star around 12000 BC.</description>

      <description>A few weeks back I shared some images of the Agave Americana entering its flowering season. Here are some updates.
Ketaki (Agave americana)
Kadamb (Neolamarckia cadamba) And look at these majestic flowers of Kadamb (Neolamarckia cadamba). The large woolly balls are its flowers packed together in this shape. The organe colour looks captivating when it catches the sunlight.
Saptaparni (Alstonia scholaris) Saptaparnis line the entrance avenue at Northstar. They are still young but already about 20 feet tall.</description>

      <description>This is Andromeda Galaxy. Photographing this one was really hard for me. Many many hours to get this image. Astronomy and astrophotography is a humbling experience. What we are seeing is 2.5 million light years away. And it is still the closest galaxy to ours. This imageAndromeda contains more than 1 trillion stars. I still have a long way to go to improve my astro work but I&amp;rsquo;m proud of this one.</description>

      <title>How I was Introduced to Borges</title>

      <description>Sometimes I wonder how I stumbled upon Borges. I remember one passage that shattered my mind. The opening paragraph of Michel Foucault&amp;rsquo;s The Order of Things had these lines:
This book first arose out of a passage in Borges, out of the laughter that shattered, as I read the passage, all the familiar landmarks of my thought - our thought, the thought that bears the stamp of our age and our geography - breaking up all the ordered surfaces and all the planes with which we are accustomed to tame the wild profusion of existing things, and continuing long afterwards to disturb and threaten with collapse our age-old distinction between the Same and the Other.</description>

      <description>This week I led a close reading of Jorge Luis Borges&amp;rsquo;s short story The Babylon Lottery. It is one of my favourite short stories.

Let&amp;rsquo;s acknowledge the problem, so we can get working
A couple of years ago I wrote in a dejected Facebook post that I spend more of my time in authority appeasement then on creative work. While I have learned to refrain from making caustic remarks, what remains true is that the fundamental nature of relationship between private Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and departments is one of distrust and whataboutery.</description>

      <description>In all matters of taste and rankings and classifications that we inadvertently take part in our daily lives, I go back to Bourdieu and his thoughts on distinction:
Taste classifies, and it classifies the classifier. Social subjects, classified by their classifications, distinguish themselves by the distinctions they make, between the beautiful and the ugly, the distinguished and the vulgar, in which their position in the objective classifications is expressed or betrayed.</description>
