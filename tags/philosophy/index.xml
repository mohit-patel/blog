      <description>In 2002, I was ravelling to one of my favourite places in India - Shimla. Viceregal Lodge in Shimla is a beautiful building, housing the Indian Institute of Advanced Study. There is a small book store in the campus. While rummaging to antiquated books, I chanced upon Education and Humanism by Sabira K. Zaidi. I had never heard of her, and probably most have not. I bought the only copy available, clearly in disuse and disrepair, pages smelling of the decaying yellow-tinted paper.</description>

      <description>Ist mir mîn leben getroumet, oder ist es war? Have I dreamt my life, or was it a true one?
-Walther von der Vogelweide
Rhythm of Learning, Rhythm of Life.
Why did I write this for Northstar? More often than not, my thoughts are not teased out of the ball of wire mesh that they are. The first stirring of the poetic thought is perhaps uniquely undeterred, unmeshed. Some readers of poetry would say that the first reading is too timid, too unsure.</description>

      <title>Sanctuary at Raga</title>
      <link>https://mohit-patel.github.io/gallery/sanctuary-at-raga/</link>

      <guid>https://mohit-patel.github.io/gallery/sanctuary-at-raga/</guid>
      <description>Raga is a sanctuary amidst swathes of dry, arid expanse. It is incredible, almost magical, to see what a small parcel of land, taken care of, loved, can do for our ecology. The primary dwellers of Raga are the trees, plants, birds and animals. Our ecology is kind and strong, caring and wanton in equal measure.
In early winter mornings at Raga, I find a solace that is rare, nearly impossible to feel in the city.</description>

      <title>Discussion on Philosophy of Wildlife Conservation</title>
      <link>https://mohit-patel.github.io/post/philosophy_wildlife/</link>

      <description>I look forward to Fridays each week. Fridays are for Noesis, our philosophy class. Over the years I have veered more and more towards literature and philosophy embedded in literature. But sometimes, we take up something topical and dive deep in to it. 29th July, Friday was International Tiger Day. I thought it would be a good opportunity to discuss about the philosophy of wildlife conservation.
I am deeply moved by the jungles of India.</description>

      <description>Anahata at Raga Svara
It is easy to believe that Raga Svara is a &amp;ldquo;business&amp;rdquo; and that it is different from Northstar or RKU, which are our learning institutions. But that would be an error. If anything, Raga is an even more potent form of learning. Raga is about bringing back the prime mover of transformation within one&amp;rsquo;s self, which so often is not the case in formal learning.</description>

      <title>Emil Cioran and the Impossibility of Meaning</title>

      <description>And so I begin my dive in to Emil Cioran. I have never been optimistic about anything in my life. And Cioran resonates with me like very few others have. Just leaving some aphorisms below. May be someday I will write more about it. But really, would there be any point to that?

      <description>We had session on the Problem of Evil. A very basic reading to start would be this. I aslo recommend reading two chapter from Fyodor Dostevsky&amp;rsquo;s The Brothers Karamazov: The Rebellion and The Grand Inquisitor.</description>

      <description>As an educator, one of the key ideas that I explore is thinking. One of the goals to start Noesis, my philosophy class at The Northstar School, was to learn and teach the process of thinking with students and educators. I used to say that learning the process of thinking is an extremely important skill. I still believe that. My primary influence in this regard has been John Dewey. In his book How We Think, he writes</description>

      <title>The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas</title>

      <description>We will be reading a short story by Ursula Le Guin. She is one of the greatest Scifi writers (and one of my favourites). This short story, The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas, presents a moral dilemma.
Ursula Le Guin shows a city; full of happy people; people without bondage and guilt; dancing in carnivals under bright, clear skies. Their perfect lives have just one condition: a single child tortured indefinitely.</description>

      <description>कबीरा कुआँ एक है,
पानी भरे अनेक
भांडे ही में भेद है,
पानी सब में एक
-Kabir
O Kabir, there is but one well
And many who draw
Difference is the vessel
Water stays the same.
(my poor translation)
Hermann Hesse, like Kabir, is one of those writers who can convey deep ideas with incredibly lucid writing. The Glass Bead Game is an exploration of many ideas. I was piqued by one on method.</description>

      <title>Porosity of Boundaries</title>

      <description>One major objective for Raga Svara is to create, what I call, “Porosity of Boundaries”. I want to make the solid walls between apparently different ideas more porous, more accommodating. One such boundary is between western medicine and our traditional medicine. I have thought for quite sometime about Indian traditional systems, whether therapeutic or belief systems (many times they merge seamlessly) and their place in Raga Svara.
Ayurveda (perhaps the most popular among our traditional medicine systems) is loved and trusted by many.</description>

      <description>As we go through the greatest humanitarian crisis of modern times, it is hard to maintain a semblance of sanity. So much suffering, so much pain all around. What can words do to those who have lost the ones they love? All the pent-up anger and pain, where will it unleash?
It feels like I am in some sort of waking sleep. So many people, including my relatives have passed away.</description>

      <title>Pause and Connect with Nature</title>

      <description>Raga - Nature
Pause and connect with nature. We are building a place where we can pause and connect with nature.
We have forgotten how to cooperate with nature. We are habituated to establishing our dominion in all aspects of life, including nature. Living in harmony with nature is long gone. We use her for our gains which comes at the cost of other rightful members of the habitat. We have forgotten to respond to the seasonal and temporal patterns of nature, much to our own physical and psychological detriment.</description>
