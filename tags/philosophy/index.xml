      <description>I look forward to Fridays each week. Fridays are for Noesis, our philosophy class. Over the years I have veered more and more towards literature and philosophy embedded in literature. But sometimes, we take up something topical and dive deep in to it. 29th July, Friday was International Tiger Day. I thought it would be a good opportunity to discuss about the philosophy of wildlife conservation.
I am deeply moved by the jungles of India.</description>

      <description>Anahata at Raga Svara
It is easy to believe that Raga Svara is a &amp;ldquo;business&amp;rdquo; and that it is different from Northstar or RKU, which are our learning institutions. But that would be an error. If anything, Raga is an even more potent form of learning. Raga is about bringing back the prime mover of transformation within one&amp;rsquo;s self, which so often is not the case in formal learning.</description>
