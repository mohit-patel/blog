      <description>One of the key pillars of Raga Svara Approach is Ecological Wellbeing. Apart from many sustainability initiatives at our campus, we have initiated Habitat Collective with the aim to create an environment to think about ethical, and even aesthetic, responses to nature. Our goal at Habitat Collective is thoughtful action in conservation of biodiversity and conversation on environmental ethics.
At Raga Svara, we think deeply about our food choices from multiple perspectives:</description>

      <title>One Year of Raga Svara</title>

      <description>A year of Raga Svara. It has now been 1 year since we opened for guests.
When we started building this place, many summers ago, the thought of operational functioning was far away, nearly impossible and, honestly, a bit repulsive. One cannot see a thing of beauty suddenly have practical import. But that&amp;rsquo;s what we all were working for. Living at the fulcrum of opposing forces is my life&amp;rsquo;s work.</description>

      <description>Green Bee-eater I spotted this Green Bee-eater today morning. It is fairly common to see in rural areas. Bee-eaters eat insects, especially bees, wasps and ants. This is the first time I have managed to photograph one with a bee in its mouth.

Coppersmith Barbet The coppersmith barbet (Psilopogon haemacephalus), also called crimson-breasted barbet and coppersmith, is an Asian barbet with crimson forehead and throat, known for its metronomic call that sounds similar to a coppersmith striking metal with a hammer.</description>

      <title>Sanctuary at Raga</title>

      <description>Raga is a sanctuary amidst swathes of dry, arid expanse. It is incredible, almost magical, to see what a small parcel of land, taken care of, loved, can do for our ecology. The primary dwellers of Raga are the trees, plants, birds and animals. Our ecology is kind and strong, caring and wanton in equal measure.
In early winter mornings at Raga, I find a solace that is rare, nearly impossible to feel in the city.</description>

      <title>Thoughts on Hospitality</title>

      <description>With Raga Svara, and with Northstar as well, but more acutely at Raga, I come to the question of étranger or xenos. I am unable to take on the role of a subservient host. Hospitality is an act of giving and receiving, a game if you will. The rules and codes must be adhered to. However, it always remains a struggle. It is never a transaction.
While all our services are priced, value truly remains outside of economic rationality.</description>

      <description>Aristotle said something to the effect that nature has made all things specifically for the sake of man and that the value of non-human thing in nature is merely instrumental. This line of thinking troubles me. And, it continues till this day. The inherent drive for dominion of man over nature. It is not just Aristotle, although he seems to be foremost in a long line of similar thought. Genesis 1: 27–8 states: And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over fish of the sea, and over fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</description>

      <title>A Thought on Raga Svara</title>

      <description>We build institutions. Sometimes I wonder why? The question whether it makes &amp;ldquo;business&amp;rdquo; sense does not appeal to me. I cannot think in traditional entrepreneurial terms (not proud of the fact). What we are making is a place of extraordinary experience. There are many mental frameworks that I use in thinking about the institutions that we build. One of the frameworks is prioritising LESS but GREAT over MORE and FLIMSY. Among the very few businessmen/entrepreneurs that I admire is Yvon Chouinard of Patagonia.</description>

      <title>Pause and Connect with Nature</title>

      <description>Raga - Nature
Pause and connect with nature. We are building a place where we can pause and connect with nature.
We have forgotten how to cooperate with nature. We are habituated to establishing our dominion in all aspects of life, including nature. Living in harmony with nature is long gone. We use her for our gains which comes at the cost of other rightful members of the habitat. We have forgotten to respond to the seasonal and temporal patterns of nature, much to our own physical and psychological detriment.</description>

      <title>Pause and Escape Chaos</title>

      <description>We live a life of interruptions. Unceasing stream of stimulations. Notifications from messengers, social media, emails, shopping apps, and a thousand more. It is killing our focus like death by a thousand paper cuts. We need apps to keep us focused and then they themselves keep us distracted. The urge to refresh and check for notifications is insatiable.
People get texts, and they respond. The responders then at some point become initiators, and the story goes on.</description>

      <title>Pause and Fight Disease</title>

      <description>We are building a place where we can pause and fight disease.
The core element of our approach is to provide therapeutic relief to the malaise of the body and mind. Ancient Indian wisdom and therapeutic practices of Ayurveda and Yoga are fully realised within our “home”. Co-existence of traditional approaches and modern systems is not only possible but essential to move towards a broader conception of health and wellness.</description>
