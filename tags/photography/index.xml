      <title>Pleiades or The Seven Sisters</title>

      <description>Our lives are illuminated; sparsely, dimly. Just like pin points of starlight in the maddening blackness of the universe. Sometimes on a winter&amp;rsquo;s night, it can be achingly beautiful.
The Seven Sisters, or the Pleiades (Messier Catalogue M45), is an open star cluster in Taurus. Known as Parvin in Urdu and Krittika in Hindi, these are hot blue luminous stars embedded in a hazy reflection nebula. Mostly 7 stars are visible to the naked eye.</description>

      <title>Northstar Campus Walk - November 2022</title>

      <description>Walking around The Northstar School is meditation for me. Some images from today&amp;rsquo;s walk.
Kassod We have a few Kassod trees (Senna siamea) on the campus near the swimming pool. They are quite large now, 6 years old). To a layman, it can be easily confused with Copperpos tree, which are also present on the campus. They both have similar looking yellow flowering. Kassod flowers twice a year, once after rain till December and again in summer.</description>

      <description>On 30th October 2022, I visited Khijadiya Bird Sanctuary. This was my second visit. Its about 70 kms from Rajkot. One of my favorite things is to be in forests and jungles. Khijadiya has great diversity of native and migratory birds. Since October is just the onset of winter, I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to see more migratory birds. My camera does not have a long zoom range (230mm on crop sensor), so I am unable to give justice to these majestic birds.</description>

      <description>I visited the Black Buck National Park in Velvadar (Bhavnagar) on 28th October 2022. This was my first trip to this park. It is protected area names after Black Bucks.
Landscape The landscape is a gorgeous swathe of copper-gold grasses.

      <description>This is the Triangulum Galaxy. It is a spiral galaxy 2.73 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Triangulum. It is one of the most distant permanent objects that can be viewed with the naked eye. However, it is impossible to see it in any city or small town. There needs to be almost zero light pollution to see it. Even with 150 images stacked together, my image (above) shows a faint galaxy.</description>

      <description>My third attempt at this deep sky object. I took over 150 images of 30 seconds each and stacked them together to get a final image. The light pollution is making it more and more difficult to do any night sky observing. The universe is up there to see only if we could be mindful about artificial lights.

      <description>The central star cluster in this photo is the Globular Cluster in constellation Pegasus. This is my second cluster photo after [[Hercules Globular Cluster]] I have been able to do a better job at the capturing the incredible star density. I do not wish to make technical observations. These photographs are meant to create a poetic image. It has no past and no future. Just an emergence in a reader&amp;rsquo;s psyche.</description>

      <description>I love photographing solitary stars. I love the simplicity of the composition. This is Vega. It is a bright star (brihgtest in the constellation Lyra). Vega used to be Earth&amp;rsquo;s pole star around 12000 BC.

      <description>This is Andromeda Galaxy. Photographing this one was really hard for me. Many many hours to get this image. Astronomy and astrophotography is a humbling experience. What we are seeing is 2.5 million light years away. And it is still the closest galaxy to ours. This imageAndromeda contains more than 1 trillion stars. I still have a long way to go to improve my astro work but I&amp;rsquo;m proud of this one.</description>

      <description>With the incredibly light polluted city of Rajkot, I continue to fail at getting any sort of deep sky objects. More than 50% moon brightness added to my misery. Even with new moon, I barely manage to see anything below 35 degree altitude. Light pollution is the least talked about perhaps. The maddening LED hoardings blinding the eye at signals, uplighters on buildings, random spotlights during events, and much more.</description>

      <description>So I had stopped photographing the skies for some months. I was not getting to a point of clicking any photos, let alone getting good ones. I simply couldn&amp;rsquo;t set up the gear properly. Astrophotography is highly technical requiring complex and sensitive equipment and some very quaint softwares which seem like they were made in late 90s. For every imaging session, it takes me about an hour of setup time. It takes me another 2 hours or for image capture.</description>

      <description>I have been wanting to combine my interests in astronomy and photography by exploring deep sky imaging. I have spent many hours getting this first image of Orion Nebula. This is a diffuse nebula in the Orion constellation. It is about 1500 light years away. About 700 new stars are being formed in the gases of this nebula. How incredible that I can see this nursery of stars from our planet.</description>
