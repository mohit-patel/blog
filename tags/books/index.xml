      <description>One of the greatest of writers, for me, is Stanislaw Lem. I think that sci-fi has the most natural affinity to philosophical realm. Lem (and PKD and LeGuin) seamlessly travel between sci-fi and philosophy. I read Lem&amp;rsquo;s Solaris many years ago after watching Steven Soderbergh&amp;rsquo;s movie. I did not know of Andrei Tarkovsky&amp;rsquo;s masterpiece at the time. Later I watched that too. Solaris (the book) remains one of the greatest works on the unfathomable and mysterious.</description>

      <description>Over the years I have developed a system of reading where I alternate between philosophy and science-fiction books. At almost any given time, I&amp;rsquo;d be reading either one. I find it extremely hard to find a science-fiction author who I enjoy, primarily in style of prose and sweep of concepts. Some of my favourites are Stanislaw Lem, Philip K. Dick, Ursula LeGuin and Alastair Reynolds. Over the last few months I must have tried at least 10 different authors, unable to connect with any.</description>
