      <description>Happy Teachers&amp;rsquo; Day to all teachers.
Hermann Hesse said, &amp;ldquo;Teachers are more essential than anything else, men and women who can give the young the ability to judge and distinguish, who serve them as examples of the honouring of truth, obedience to the things of the spirit&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
Teachers and administrators (us) are essentially humans. We are people before we are teachers. And the failings and travails of being human cannot be discarded in the process of becoming a teacher.</description>

Let&amp;rsquo;s acknowledge the problem, so we can get working
A couple of years ago I wrote in a dejected Facebook post that I spend more of my time in authority appeasement then on creative work. While I have learned to refrain from making caustic remarks, what remains true is that the fundamental nature of relationship between private Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and departments is one of distrust and whataboutery.</description>

      <description>In all matters of taste and rankings and classifications that we inadvertently take part in our daily lives, I go back to Bourdieu and his thoughts on distinction:
Taste classifies, and it classifies the classifier. Social subjects, classified by their classifications, distinguish themselves by the distinctions they make, between the beautiful and the ugly, the distinguished and the vulgar, in which their position in the objective classifications is expressed or betrayed.</description>
