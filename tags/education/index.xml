      <title>Centres of Condensation</title>

      <description>I borrow the phrase &amp;ldquo;Centres of Condensation&amp;rdquo; Gaston Bachelard&amp;rsquo;s Poetics of Space. Our institutions, Northstar and Raga, are thought of as, firstly, &amp;lsquo;centres&amp;rsquo;. Taken in isolation and in the prevalent context, the word &amp;lsquo;centre&amp;rsquo; has not gravitas, no weight. It is as banal as the centre of a hypothetical circle. But to me &amp;lsquo;centre&amp;rsquo; means &amp;rsquo;to centre&amp;rsquo;, the act of centring. Where does this centre lie? Within us, within our situations, in our troubles?</description>

      <description>What instrumentalism, economic ends and modernity have taken away from the original conception of school can never be fully comprehended or felt.
I meet parents who are eager to know how much we do in the school: how many subjects, how many sports games, how many languages, how many activities, and so on. If I was better at communication and convincing, I would have succeeded in explaining that in the question &amp;ldquo;how many&amp;rdquo; only the first word is important.</description>

      <description>In 2002, I was ravelling to one of my favourite places in India - Shimla. Viceregal Lodge in Shimla is a beautiful building, housing the Indian Institute of Advanced Study. There is a small book store in the campus. While rummaging to antiquated books, I chanced upon Education and Humanism by Sabira K. Zaidi. I had never heard of her, and probably most have not. I bought the only copy available, clearly in disuse and disrepair, pages smelling of the decaying yellow-tinted paper.</description>

      <description>Ist mir mîn leben getroumet, oder ist es war? Have I dreamt my life, or was it a true one?
-Walther von der Vogelweide
Rhythm of Learning, Rhythm of Life.
Why did I write this for Northstar? More often than not, my thoughts are not teased out of the ball of wire mesh that they are. The first stirring of the poetic thought is perhaps uniquely undeterred, unmeshed. Some readers of poetry would say that the first reading is too timid, too unsure.</description>

      <title>What Does it Mean to be a Teacher?</title>

      <description>Happy Teachers&amp;rsquo; Day to all teachers.
Hermann Hesse said, &amp;ldquo;Teachers are more essential than anything else, men and women who can give the young the ability to judge and distinguish, who serve them as examples of the honouring of truth, obedience to the things of the spirit&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
Teachers and administrators (us) are essentially humans. We are people before we are teachers. And the failings and travails of being human cannot be discarded in the process of becoming a teacher.</description>

Let&amp;rsquo;s acknowledge the problem, so we can get working
A couple of years ago I wrote in a dejected Facebook post that I spend more of my time in authority appeasement then on creative work. While I have learned to refrain from making caustic remarks, what remains true is that the fundamental nature of relationship between private Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and departments is one of distrust and whataboutery.</description>

      <description>In all matters of taste and rankings and classifications that we inadvertently take part in our daily lives, I go back to Bourdieu and his thoughts on distinction:
Taste classifies, and it classifies the classifier. Social subjects, classified by their classifications, distinguish themselves by the distinctions they make, between the beautiful and the ugly, the distinguished and the vulgar, in which their position in the objective classifications is expressed or betrayed.</description>

      <description>I wrote this sometime back. Resharing on the occasion of Teachers&amp;rsquo; Day in India.
What, then, is truth? A mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms – in short, a sum of human relations, which have been enhanced, transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically, and which after long use seem firm, canonical, and obligatory to a people: truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are; metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous power; coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as coins.</description>

      <description>Richard Rorty Rorty presents knowledge, not as a representation of the real world or a “match” between knowledge and reality, but rather as a collection of conceptual structures that are adapted, or viable, within a person&amp;rsquo;s range of experience. In other words, the person&amp;rsquo;s knowledge “fits” with the world, much like how a key fits a lock (Bodner, 1986). Each of us builds our own key by making sense of the world, and many different keys can open a given lock.</description>
