      <description>Inaugural speech at International Conference on Transformations in Engineering Education, RKU.
April 23, 2017
Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentleman.
Its an extraordinarily special day for me. Educational transformations and learning experiences, be it engineering or otherwise take up the entirety of my waking life. As a member of RK University, I am honoured that we have the privilege of hosting this conference. And as someone who cares about education, I am filled with hope seeing you all here thinking, talking and finding ways to build better institutions.</description>
