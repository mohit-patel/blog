      <description>Part 1 Jorge Luis Borges said:
Like the discovery of love, like the discovery of the sea, the discovery of Dostoevsky marks and important date in one&amp;rsquo;s life.
I discovered Fyodor Dostoevsky late in my life. It took me many attempts over some years to complete The Brothers Karamazov. It is impossible, for a mediocre thinker and writer like me, to even begin to describe the depth and contours of Dostoevsky&amp;rsquo;s writing.</description>

      <title>How I was Introduced to Borges</title>

      <description>Sometimes I wonder how I stumbled upon Borges. I remember one passage that shattered my mind. The opening paragraph of Michel Foucault&amp;rsquo;s The Order of Things had these lines:
This book first arose out of a passage in Borges, out of the laughter that shattered, as I read the passage, all the familiar landmarks of my thought - our thought, the thought that bears the stamp of our age and our geography - breaking up all the ordered surfaces and all the planes with which we are accustomed to tame the wild profusion of existing things, and continuing long afterwards to disturb and threaten with collapse our age-old distinction between the Same and the Other.</description>

      <description>This week I led a close reading of Jorge Luis Borges&amp;rsquo;s short story The Babylon Lottery. It is one of my favourite short stories.

      <title>Beginning Roberto Bolaño</title>

      <description>The greatest writer of the 20th century, if not all time, for me, is Jorge Luis Borges. And if one reads Borges, he must also read Roberto Bolaño. I haven&amp;rsquo;t read Bolaño before and I am starting with 2666. A serendipitous start with this quote in the book&amp;rsquo;s opening:
An oasis of horror in a desert of boredom. -Charles Baudelaire
And Baudelaire reminds me that I must return to Fleurs du Mal soon again.</description>

      <title>The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas</title>

      <description>We will be reading a short story by Ursula Le Guin. She is one of the greatest Scifi writers (and one of my favourites). This short story, The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas, presents a moral dilemma.
Ursula Le Guin shows a city; full of happy people; people without bondage and guilt; dancing in carnivals under bright, clear skies. Their perfect lives have just one condition: a single child tortured indefinitely.</description>

      <description>कबीरा कुआँ एक है,
पानी भरे अनेक
भांडे ही में भेद है,
पानी सब में एक
-Kabir
O Kabir, there is but one well
And many who draw
Difference is the vessel
Water stays the same.
(my poor translation)
Hermann Hesse, like Kabir, is one of those writers who can convey deep ideas with incredibly lucid writing. The Glass Bead Game is an exploration of many ideas. I was piqued by one on method.</description>
