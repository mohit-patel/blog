      <description>Walking around The Northstar School is meditation for me. Some images from today&amp;rsquo;s walk.
Kassod We have a few Kassod trees (Senna siamea) on the campus near the swimming pool. They are quite large now, 6 years old). To a layman, it can be easily confused with Copperpos tree, which are also present on the campus. They both have similar looking yellow flowering. Kassod flowers twice a year, once after rain till December and again in summer.</description>
