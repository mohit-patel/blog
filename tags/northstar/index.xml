      <description>Ist mir mîn leben getroumet, oder ist es war? Have I dreamt my life, or was it a true one?
-Walther von der Vogelweide
Rhythm of Learning, Rhythm of Life.
Why did I write this for Northstar? More often than not, my thoughts are not teased out of the ball of wire mesh that they are. The first stirring of the poetic thought is perhaps uniquely undeterred, unmeshed. Some readers of poetry would say that the first reading is too timid, too unsure.</description>

      <title>Northstar Campus Walk - November 2022</title>

      <description>Walking around The Northstar School is meditation for me. Some images from today&amp;rsquo;s walk.
Kassod We have a few Kassod trees (Senna siamea) on the campus near the swimming pool. They are quite large now, 6 years old). To a layman, it can be easily confused with Copperpos tree, which are also present on the campus. They both have similar looking yellow flowering. Kassod flowers twice a year, once after rain till December and again in summer.</description>

      <description>A few weeks back I shared some images of the Agave Americana entering its flowering season. Here are some updates.
Ketaki (Agave americana) Kadamb (Neolamarckia cadamba) And look at these majestic flowers of Kadamb (Neolamarckia cadamba). The large woolly balls are its flowers packed together in this shape. The organe colour looks captivating when it catches the sunlight. Saptaparni (Alstonia scholaris) Saptaparnis line the entrance avenue at Northstar. They are still young but already about 20 feet tall.</description>

      <description>New leaves in this young Kassod on the campus. We are in peak monsoon right now. It normally flowers after monsoon until December. The flowers are yellow and look quite pretty in bunches.
The canopy is not quite shapely yet. It&amp;#39;s still young.
This is Agave Americana and it has started flowering. The central spike is about 4 ft right now but it will go much much higher. It will flower in the most incredible way which is difficult describe.</description>

      <description>What, then, is truth? A mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms – in short, a sum of human relations, which have been enhanced, transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically, and which after long use seem firm, canonical, and obligatory to a people: truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are; metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous power; coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as coins.</description>
