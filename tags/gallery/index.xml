      <description>On 30th October 2022, I visited Khijadiya Bird Sanctuary. This was my second visit. Its about 70 kms from Rajkot. One of my favorite things is to be in forests and jungles. Khijadiya has great diversity of native and migratory birds. October is just the onset of winter, I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to see more migratory birds. My camera does not have a long zoom range (230mm on crop sensor) so I am unable to give justice to these majestic birds.</description>

      <description>I visited the Black Buck National Park in Velvadar (Bhavnagar) on 28th October 2022. This was my first trip to this park. It is protected area names after Black Bucks.
Landscape The landscape is a gorgeous swathe of copper-gold grasses.
