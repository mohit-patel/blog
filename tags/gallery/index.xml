      <description>On 30th October 2022, I visted Khijadiya Bird Sanctuary. This was my second visit. Its about 70 kms from Rajkot. One of my facurote things to do is be in forests and jungles. Khijadiya has great diversity of native and migratory birds. October is just the onset of winter, I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to see more migratory birds. I was lucky to see one solitary Great White Pelican, also known as Rosy Pelican.</description>
