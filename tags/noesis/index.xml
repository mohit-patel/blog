      <description>In 2002, I was ravelling to one of my favourite places in India - Shimla. Viceregal Lodge in Shimla is a beautiful building, housing the Indian Institute of Advanced Study. There is a small book store in the campus. While rummaging to antiquated books, I chanced upon Education and Humanism by Sabira K. Zaidi. I had never heard of her, and probably most have not. I bought the only copy available, clearly in disuse and disrepair, pages smelling of the decaying yellow-tinted paper.</description>
