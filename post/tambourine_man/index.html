  <section><p>Today, 25th May, is Bob Dylan&rsquo;s birthday. Remembering days from the past and how Dylan got entangled in my memories.</p>
<p>I had never been on a road trip with friends. It was December of 2007. We were going from Cambridge to Motherwell, near Glasgow. It was not a vacation trip. We were going for an on-site project. I hadn&rsquo;t travelled much in the UK. We were in Cambridge University&rsquo;s van. I didn&rsquo;t drive since I had no license and no confidence. I was the navigator for a while perhaps. I don&rsquo;t remember much. It was overcast, I don&rsquo;t remember if it rained. What I remember is what I felt and what I heard. I heard Bob Dylan for the first time. I had heard of Dylan and heard some of his songs, in the passing, earlier may be. But I &ldquo;listened&rdquo; to him for the first time in that trip. And Dylan played for a long time. I was coming from Pink Floyd and this sound, this folksy, raw sound was new. But it was soothing. The harmonica played on. I must have wondered about my own life when he sang:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How does it feel, how does it feel?
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown,
Like a rolling stone&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what I remember the most is Mr Tambourine Man. Sitting in the back seat, watching out of the window, drizzling outside, and unending highways. And Tambourine Man:</p>
<p>Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I&rsquo;m not sleepy and there is no place I&rsquo;m going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I&rsquo;ll come following you&hellip;
